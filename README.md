### Inspiration

I used to meditate briefly when I feel burnout or exhausted during studying.
This short time really helps me to get back on track so I can focus on my study again.
Many student might feel some pressure and stress, just like me, so I want to share this app and cheer up other friends on long journey of learning programming.<br/>
Let's work hard together! We can do it!
